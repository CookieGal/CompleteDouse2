# CompleteDouse2



* A complete decompilation of [Dickdouse's Big Game 2](https://dickdouselover22.itch.io/dickdouse-vs-world-leaked-build)
* DBG2 and by extension this decomp uses [CompleteCook](https://github.com/lavbubl/CompleteCook) as a template. Check 'em out!



# Requirements



* [Gamemaker 2024.14.2.213](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Installer-2024.14.2.213.exe)



# Differences



* The sound folder in datafiles has been omitted as it goes above the 100mb limit, plus it isn't used anyway. You should copy and paste the folder from the [base game](https://dickdouselover22.itch.io/dickdouse-vs-world-leaked-build) if you want it back
* Resource\_order has been gitignored since it isn't needed for the decomp either. It autogenerates when you open the project
* This decomp uses the latest gamemaker version for convenience. The correct version would be 2024.13.0.0
